In C, you can use nested loops, which are loops within other loops. Nested loops allow you to create more complex patterns or perform repetitive tasks with multiple levels of iteration. There are typically two types of nested loops: nested `for` loops and nested `while` loops. Here's an explanation and examples of both:

### Nested `for` Loops:
Nested `for` loops are commonly used when you want to create 2D or multi-dimensional patterns or iterate through multi-dimensional arrays.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rows, columns;

    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &rows);

    printf("Enter the number of columns: ");
    scanf("%d", &columns);

    // Nested for loop to print a rectangle of stars
    for (int i = 1; i <= rows; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= columns; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the outer loop (`i`) iterates through the rows, and the inner loop (`j`) iterates through the columns. It prints a rectangle of stars based on the specified number of rows and columns.

### Nested `while` Loops:
Nested `while` loops can also be used to achieve similar results as nested `for` loops. Here's an example of nested `while` loops that prints a triangle of numbers:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int rows, i = 1;

    printf("Enter the number of rows: ");
    scanf("%d", &rows);

    // Nested while loop to print a triangle of numbers
    while (i <= rows) {
        int j = 1;
        while (j <= i) {
            printf("%d ", j);
            j++;
        }
        printf("\n");
        i++;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the outer `while` loop (`i`) iterates through the rows, and the inner `while` loop (`j`) iterates through the numbers within each row. It prints a triangle of numbers based on the specified number of rows.

Nested loops can be used for more complex patterns and tasks, such as iterating through multi-dimensional arrays, creating nested structures, and solving problems that involve multi-level iterations.
