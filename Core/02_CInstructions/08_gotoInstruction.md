The `goto` statement in the C programming language allows you to transfer control within a function to a labeled statement. While it can be a powerful tool, it is often considered bad practice and can make code harder to read and maintain if not used carefully. Here's the basic syntax for using `goto` in C:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int i = 1;

start:
    printf("This is iteration %d.\n", i);
    i++;

    if (i <= 5) {
        goto start;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we use `goto` to create a loop that prints "This is iteration X." five times. The `start` label marks the beginning of the loop, and the `goto start;` statement transfers control back to the `start` label until `i` becomes greater than 5.

However, it's important to note that using `goto` can make code harder to understand and maintain, as it can lead to spaghetti code and make debugging more challenging. In most cases, structured control flow constructs like `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops, as well as `if` and `switch` statements, are preferred over `goto`.

# Why goto statement is not to use

The `goto` statement in the C language is considered bad practice and is discouraged for several reasons:

1. Readability and Maintainability: Code that uses `goto` can quickly become hard to read and understand. It can lead to "spaghetti code" where the flow of control is difficult to follow. This makes it challenging for other developers (and even the original author) to maintain and modify the code.

2. Debugging Complexity: When code uses `goto`, debugging becomes more difficult. Finding the source of a bug or understanding the control flow can be much more challenging when `goto` is used liberally.

3. Code Structure: `goto` bypasses structured programming constructs like loops and conditional statements, making it easy to create unstructured and convoluted code. These constructs exist in the language precisely to provide a clear and organized way to control program flow.

4. Portability: Code that uses `goto` may be less portable because different compilers and platforms may handle `goto` differently. This can lead to unexpected behavior in different environments.

5. Better Alternatives: C provides a range of structured control flow constructs such as `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops, as well as `if` and `switch` statements, which offer a more readable and maintainable way to control program flow. These constructs are generally preferred over `goto` because they make code easier to understand and maintain.

While there are some legitimate use cases for `goto`, they are extremely rare and usually involve low-level programming or specific optimization needs. In most cases, you can write cleaner and more maintainable code without using `goto`, which is why it's often considered best practice to avoid it in C programming.
Modern C programming practices generally discourage the use of `goto` in favor of more structured and readable code.
