# Array in C
In C, an array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow you to group multiple values of the same type under a single name, making it easier to work with collections of data. Here are some key aspects of arrays in C:

**1. Declaration and Initialization:**
You declare an array by specifying the data type of its elements, followed by the array name and the size of the array in square brackets.

```c
data_type array_name[array_size];
```

For example:

```c
int numbers[5]; // Declares an integer array named 'numbers' with 5 elements
```

You can also initialize an array at the time of declaration:

```c
int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initializes an integer array with values
```

There are Different types of Array
1. One-Dimensional Array
2. MultiDimensional Array
