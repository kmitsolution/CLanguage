# Operators in C
In the C programming language, operators are symbols that represent computations or operations to be performed on data. C provides a wide range of operators that can be classified into the following categories:

## Binary Operators 
Binary operators in C are operators that perform operations on two operands (values or variables). These operators take two inputs and produce a result based on the operation being performed. Here's a list of common binary operators in C:

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Bitwise Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Comma Operator
7. Conditional (Ternary) Operator

## Unary Operators
Unary operators in C are operators that operate on a single operand (value or variable). These operators perform various operations on a single input and can change the value or state of the operand. Here are common unary operators in C:

1. Increment and Decrement Operators**:
2. Bitwise NOT
3. Logical NOT
4. Address-of Operator
5. Indirection (Dereference) Operator
6. Sizeof Operator
These are some of the fundamental operators in C. Operators allow you to perform various operations on variables and values, making C a versatile language for performing a wide range of computations.
