Conditional compilation in the C preprocessor allows you to include or exclude blocks of code from your program during compilation based on certain conditions. This can be very useful for creating platform-specific code, enabling or disabling debugging features, or configuring your program for different scenarios. Conditional compilation is typically done using `#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#if`, `#elif`, `#else`, and `#endif` directives. Here are some examples of conditional compilation in C:

1. **Using `#ifdef` and `#endif`:**

   ```c
   #define DEBUG

   #ifdef DEBUG
   // Debugging code here
   #endif

   // Rest of the code
   ```

   In this example, if `DEBUG` is defined (usually by using a compiler option or a `#define` directive), the debugging code will be included; otherwise, it will be excluded.

2. **Using `#ifndef` and `#endif`:**

   ```c
   #ifndef DEBUG
   // Production code here
   #endif

   // Rest of the code
   ```

   This is the inverse of the previous example. The production code is included only if `DEBUG` is not defined.

3. **Using `#if`, `#else`, and `#endif` for Conditional Compilation:**

   ```c
   #define PLATFORM_WINDOWS

   #if defined(PLATFORM_WINDOWS)
       // Windows-specific code
   #elif defined(PLATFORM_LINUX)
       // Linux-specific code
   #else
       // Code for other platforms
   #endif

   // Rest of the code
   ```

   Here, you use `#if` to check conditions and include the appropriate code block based on the defined platform.

4. **Using `#if` and Logical Operators:**

   ```c
   #define DEBUG_LEVEL 2

   #if DEBUG_LEVEL > 1
       // More detailed debugging code
   #elif DEBUG_LEVEL > 0
       // Basic debugging code
   #else
       // No debugging code
   #endif

   // Rest of the code
   ```

   You can use logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) and comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `==`, etc.) in `#if` directives to create more complex conditions.

5. **Conditional Compilation with `#define` and `#undef`:**

   ```c
   #define FEATURE_X

   #ifdef FEATURE_X
       // Code related to FEATURE_X
   #else
       // Code without FEATURE_X
   #endif

   #undef FEATURE_X  // Undefine FEATURE_X to exclude the code below this point

   // Code that should not include FEATURE_X
   ```

   You can use `#undef` to undefine a macro, which can be useful for selectively disabling code blocks.

Conditional compilation is a powerful feature in C that allows you to tailor your code to specific requirements and configurations without changing the source code itself. It's commonly used for debugging, platform-specific code, feature toggles, and more.
