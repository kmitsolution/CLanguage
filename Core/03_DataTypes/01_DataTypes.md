# Data Types in C
In the C programming language, data types are used to specify the type of data that a variable can hold. C provides several built-in data types to accommodate different types of data, and they can be categorized into basic, derived, and user-defined data types. Let's explore these C data types in detail:

### 1. Primitive or Basic Data Types:
   These are the fundamental data types that represent the most basic building blocks for variables.

   1. int
   2. float
   3. double
   4. char
   5. void
   

### 2. Derived Data Types:
   These data types are derived from basic data types and are used to create more complex data structures.

   1. Array & String
   2. Pointer
   
   
### 3. User-Defined Data Types:
   These data types are created by the programmer using typedef and struct or union declarations.

   1. typedef
   2. struct (structure)
   3. union
   4. enum
   
These are the fundamental data types in C, and they serve as the building blocks for creating variables and complex data structures. Choosing the appropriate data type for a variable is crucial to ensure efficient memory usage and proper representation of data in your C programs.
