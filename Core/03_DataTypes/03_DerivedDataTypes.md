In C, derived data types are user-defined data types that are created by combining one or more basic data types or other derived data types. These derived data types are used to create more complex and structured data representations. Here are some commonly used derived data types in C:

1. **Arrays**: An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in contiguous memory locations. Elements in an array can be accessed using an index.

   ```c
   int numbers[5]; // Declares an integer array of size 5
   ```
   **Strings** String is the collection of characters

   ```c
   char names[5]; // Declare a string with 5 character length
   ```

3. **Pointers**: Pointers are variables that store memory addresses. They are used to point to other data types, allowing for dynamic memory allocation and manipulation.

   ```c
   int *ptr; // Declares a pointer to an integer
   ```
